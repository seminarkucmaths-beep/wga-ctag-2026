  <h1>Pre-Conference Workshop on Graph Algorithms</h1>
  <p>February 2–4, 2026</p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>The two-day Workshop on Graph Algorithms is organized as an introductory programme to the Conference on <em>Theory</em> and <em>Algorithms</em> <em>on Graphs</em>. It aims to equip research scholars, postgraduate students, and young faculty members with a strong foundation in the core concepts and techniques of graph theory and algorithms.
Designed as a bridge between introductory knowledge and advanced research, the workshop will enable participants to engage more effectively with the technical sessions and research discussions of the conference. With a focused emphasis on algorithmic perspectives of graphs—an area addressed in relatively few workshops—the programme offers a valuable opportunity to explore both foundational ideas and computational approaches in graph theory.</p>
