  <h2><strong>About the Department</strong></h2>
  <p>The Department of Mathematical Sciences at Kannur University, Mangattuparamba Campus, was established in 2008 with the launch of a four-semester M.Sc. programme in Mathematics. Since its inception, the department has been committed to promoting advanced education and high-quality research in mathematics, with a particular focus on serving the academic community of the northern region of Kerala.

The department is a recognised research centre of Kannur University and has developed a vibrant and collaborative research environment over the years. Several research scholars have successfully completed their doctoral studies here, while many others are currently engaged in active research across diverse areas of mathematics.

The department also hosts an NBHM-funded library, equipped with a rich collection of books and journals that strongly support both teaching and research activities. At present, the department offers M.Sc. Mathematics and Ph.D. programmes, combining rigorous academic training with opportunities for innovative and independent research.

In addition, a five-year Integrated Master’s Programme, introduced in 2025, aims to nurture young mathematical talent from an early stage. The major research areas pursued in the department include graph theory, harmonic analysis, operator algebra, and fuzzy mathematics.</p>
